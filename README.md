# TacoWave: Fast and High-Fidelity End-to-End Speech Synthesis

TacoWave is a fast and high-quality **end-to-end (E2E) speech synthesis**
framework designed to generate natural-sounding speech with **low inference
latency** and **high perceptual fidelity**. The model balances the trade-off
between **model size, synthesis accuracy, and real-time performance**, often
referred to as the *magic triangle* in speech synthesis research.

TacoWave extends the attention-based Tacotron family by incorporating
**forward attention**, **GELU activations**, and a **deepened PostNet**, and
leverages **BigVGAN** for high-fidelity waveform generation from Mel
spectrograms.

## 🔍 Key Contributions

- Forward attention mechanism for **stable and monotonic alignment**
- GELU activation for improved **prosody preservation and training stability**
- Deepened PostNet for refined Mel-spectrogram quality
- End-to-end integration with **BigVGAN** neural vocoder
- Fast inference with **47.16× real-time factor** on NVIDIA GTX 1080

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

TacoWave follows a two-stage pipeline:

1. **Text → Mel Spectrogram**
   - Character embedding
   - Convolutional encoder with GELU
   - Bidirectional LSTM
   - Forward attention-based decoder
   - Deep PostNet refinement

2. **Mel Spectrogram → Waveform**
   - BigVGAN GAN-based neural vocoder

This design enables high-quality waveform synthesis while maintaining
real-time capability.

## 📊 Dataset

Experiments were conducted using the **LJ Speech Dataset**, which contains
high-quality recordings from a single female speaker with aligned transcripts.

- Sampling rate: 22,050 Hz  
- Total duration: ~24 hours  
- Total utterances: 13,100

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tacowave
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

## 🏋️ Training

To train TacoWave from scratch:

```bash
python train.py   --output_directory=outdir   --log_directory=logdir
```

(Optional) Monitor training using TensorBoard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=outdir/logdir
```

---

## 🔁 Training with Pretrained Weights

Training can be initialized using pretrained Tacotron-style weights to speed
up convergence:

```bash
python train.py   --output_directory=outdir   --log_directory=logdir   --warm_start
```

---

## ⚡ Distributed & Mixed Precision Training

```bash
python -m multiproc train.py   --output_directory=outdir   --log_directory=logdir   --hparams=distributed_run=True,fp16_run=True
```

---

## 🎧 Inference

- Load a trained TacoWave checkpoint
- Generate Mel spectrograms from text
- Convert Mel spectrograms to waveform using BigVGAN

⚠️ Ensure both TacoWave and BigVGAN use the **same Mel configuration**.
